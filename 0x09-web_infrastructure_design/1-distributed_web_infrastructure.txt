The design with 2 servers (Local DNS Server, External DNS Server) is a bit better than the previous one where there are ny ne server.

Local DNS Server: It resolves domain names for internal resources, such as the web servers hosting internal applications or services, and forwards external DNS queries to external DNS servers for resolution.

External DNS Server: It resolves domain names for publicly accessible websites, including the domain name associated with the organization's web infrastructure (e.g., www.foobar.com), and provides authoritative DNS responses to clients outside the organization's network.

The need to add an additional server is due to if you have a one server it will lead to overloading the server since all the tasks needed to be done on the server side is done by that lone server.

i.e: all hmtl requests, all database information retriaval is done by that server. which leads to late responses.
	To handle that we introduce a new server to help in providing the database responces and a load balancer such that in case of heavy traffic the requests are 	eveny balanced.
